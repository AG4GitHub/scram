# This is a probability input file to test exact algorithm for
# probability calculation. They system has three unique events with respective
# probabilities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.
# The minimal cut sets are {AB} and {BC}.
# The total probability of the top event is
# P = P(AB) + P(BC) - P(AB*BC) = P(AB) + P(BC) - P(ABC) =>
# P = P(A)P(B) + P(B)P(C) - P(A)P(B)P(C)
# P = 0.1*0.2 + 0.2*0.3 - 0.1*0.2*0.3 = 0.074
