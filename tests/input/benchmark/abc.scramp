# This file contains probabilities for testing exact probability calculation
# algorithm. The system contains three events with respective probabilities of
# 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.
# Therefore, the expected total exact probability for independent events is
# P = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 - 0.1*0.2 - 0.1*0.3 - 0.2*0.3 + 0.1*0.2*0.3 = 0.496
