Characteristics of Transfer In and Transfer Out:
* Get the list of transfers
    ** If transfer is a root, then check if there are other nodes in the main
        file. If so, it is a mistake.( May put a special flag for this case)
    ** Transfer can list their parent as only a intermediate event or top
        event. No dangling transfers. (Check just like other nodes.)
    ** Intermediate event can have many transferIn.
    ** ONLY one transferOut per intermediate event
* Check if the transfer list is initiated correctly
    ** Only one intermediate event can follow the transfer out
    ** None of the elements in the transfer tree should refer to elements in
        the original tree.
    ** Transfer Intermediate events may show up in several places and cause
        conflicts with the uniqueness of intermediate events.
        May append some suffix to avoid problems.
* Attach one list to corresponding 


Note:
    * If a user wants to re-use intermediate event in multiple places,
        transfers should be used instead of finding unique names for those
        intermediate events with the same basic events.
    * Warn a user about cyclic inclusions.
    * May create probability file inclusion logic.
