SCRAM GUI Front-End
###################

The GUI front-end provides a more convenient and user-friendly way to build
fault trees, event trees, and other analysis components. It should be easier to
visualize and setup the analysis using this front-end tool. However, some of
more advanced functionality may not be available through the GUI, but it should
be possible to tweak the GUI generated input files to get the desired results.

The GUI front-end is developed with `Qt and Qt Creator`_.
`The basic concepts of UI`_ are followed.
