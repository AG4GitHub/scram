Probability Analysis

Since minimal cut sets may neither be mutually exclusive
nor independent, direct use of the sets' total probabilities may be inaccurate.
In addition, rare event approximation may not be appropriate
for events with large probabilities.

In order to account for the above deficiencies, brute force algorithm is
implemented to calculate total probability of a top event in a
fault tree. However, note that this algorithm still assumes independence of
primary events in the fault tree.


The Exact Probability Calculation Implementation
=================================================

The general probability formula for sets is expanded recursively.
In each iteration, some sets are merged in order to account for common members
in minimal cut sets. This algorithm is also used for series expansion, giving
the Sylvester-Poincar√© expansion.

The Approximate Probability Calculation Implementation
=======================================================

Approximate calculations are implemented in order to reduce calculation
time. The series expansion of the exact formula is applied.
This feature is the default. The default value for series is set to 7
to get a conservative result while having acceptable performance.
In general, it is impractical to include more than 8 sums, so the suggestion
is to include between 4 and 8 sums.
In addition, cut-off probability for cut sets can be applied to discard
sets with low probabilities. The default cut-off is 1e-8.

The Rare-Event Approximation
=============================
Given that probabilities of events are very small value less than 0.1, only the
first series in the probability equation may be used as a conservative
approximation; that is, the total probability is the sum of all probabilities
of minimal cut sets. Ideally, this approximation gives good results for
independent minimal cut sets with very low probabilities. However, if the cut
set probabilities are high, the total probability may exceed 1.0.

The Min-Cut-Upper Bound (MCUB) Approximation
=============================================
This method calculates the total probability by subtracting the probability
of all minimal cut sets' being successful from 1.0; thus, the total probability
never exceeds 1.0. Non-independence of the minimal cut sets introduce
the major discrepancy for this technique. However, the MCUB approximation
provides non-conservative estimation for non-coherent trees containing
*NOT* logic. There are other limitations described by Don Wakefield in
"You Can't Just Build Trees and Call It PSA."

Probability Types
=================

Various probability types and distributions are accepted as described in
OpenPSA Model Exchange Format, for example, constant values, exponential with
two or four parameters, uniform, normal, log-normal distributions.

Bellow is a brief example. For more information, please take a look at OpenPSA
MEF format documentation on http://open-psa.org

**P-model**
    The probability of an event occurring when the time to failure is
    unknown or unpredictable.

**Lambda-model or Exponential with Two Parameters**
    The probability that a primary event will occur within
    a given period of time (t). Appropriate for events within
    systems that are continuously operating and have a known
    probability of failure during a unit time period (:math:`\lambda`).
    The event probability is equal to

    .. math::

        P = 1-\exp(-\lambda*t)

    For small lambda and time, the approximation is

    .. math::

        P \approx \lambda*t

Probability Calculations
========================

The described assumptions may be applied for calculation of a cut set and total
probabilities:

- Independence of events (dependence may be simulated by common cause).
- Rare event approximation (must be enforced by a user).
- Min-Cut-Upper Bound Approximation (must be enforced by a user).
- Cut-off probability for minimal cut sets (the default value is 1e-8).
- Brute force probability calculation if the rare event approximation is not
  good enough. This brute force calculation may be expensive and require
  much more time. (the default method for probability calculations).

.. note::
    For most calculations, rare event approximation and event
    independence may be applied satisfactorily. However, if the rare event
    approximation produces too large probability, SCRAM can use the upper bound
    method. An appropriate warning will be given even if the user enforces
    the rare event approximation. It is suggested that the maximum number of
    series should be around 4-8. The default value is conservative 7.
    There are N sums and :math:`2^N` terms for N minimal cut sets, so
    the N number of series for calculations can be enforced by a user.


Importance Analysis
===================

Importance analysis is performed for basic events that appear in minimal
cut sets. Currently, for calculations
the same configurations are applied as for probability analysis.
The analysis is performed by default on command-line call with probability
data. The following factors are calculated:

    - Fussel-Vesely Diagnosis Importance Factor (DIF)
    - Birnbaum Marginal Importance Factor (MIF)
    - Critical Importance Factor (CIF)
    - Risk Reduction Worth (RRW)
    - Risk Achievement Worth (RAW)
