Steps to verify an input for Fault Tree:
    * ignore comment lines
    * find opening brace '{'
    * all three input elements are listed in correct order.
    * input values are correct
    * each line contains only two strings
    * find closing brace '}'
    * create a node:
        ** Parent exists and is not a basic event (may change for CCF)
        ** Non-basic event has a non-unique name
        ** Basic events with several parents are allowed (put #1)
        ** Each non-basic node is not a leaf
    * Throw an error with a helpful message (line numbers, types of errors)
    * Find probabilities for basic events:
        ** Report missing probabilities
        ** Throw an error if defined doubly
        ** Warn if there more probability definitions than events
