GUI Front-End
#############

.. note:: This feature is under development.

The GUI front-end provides a more convenient and user-friendly way
to build fault trees, event trees, and other analysis components.
It should be easier to visualize and setup the analysis using this front-end tool.
However, some of more advanced functionality may not be available through the GUI,
but it should be possible to tweak the GUI-generated input files to get the desired results.

The GUI front-end is developed with `Qt5 and Qt Creator`_.
