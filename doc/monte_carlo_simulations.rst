Monte Carlo (MC) Analysis Implementation
========================================

#. Initializing events with distributions. *Not Supported*

#. Generation of an equation for MC analysis from minimal cut sets.

#. Determine the number of samples. (Set by a user) *No Support*

#. Definitions and parameters for various distributions. *Not Supported Yet*

    * May be specified by a user in an input file.
    * Distributions:

        - Uniform
        - Triangular
        - Piecewise Linear
        - Histogram
        - Discrete
        - Normal
        - Log-Normal
        - Poisson
        - Binomial
        - Beta
        - Gamma
        - Weibull
        - Exponential
        - Log-Uniform
        - Log-Triangular
