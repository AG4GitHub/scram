The overall flow of SCRAM and possible future additions.

Step 0. Type of analysis, i.e., fault tree, even tree, Markov chain, etc.


Fault Tree Analysis.
--------------------
Step 1. Reading input files. Verification of the input. Optional visual tool.
Step 1+ (Optional). Upon users' request output instruction file for graphviz
    dot to draw the tree. This is for visual verification of the input.
    Stop execution of the program.
Step 2. Create the tree for analysis.
Step 3. Perform cut set generation.
Step 4. Perform analysis.
Step 5. Output the analysis results.


Event Tree Analysis.
--------------------
Step 1. Reading input files. Verification of the input. Optional visual tool.
Step 1+ (Optional). Upon users' request output instruction file for graphviz
    dot to draw the tree. This is for visual verification of the input.
    Stop execution of the program.
Step 2. Create the tree for analysis.
Step 3. Perform calculations.
Step 4. Output the results.


Future Additions.
-----------------
1. Simple event tree analysis.
2. More efficient algorithms for faul tree analysis.
3. More types of gates for fault trees: exclusive OR, priority AND, inhibit.
4. More types of events for fault trees: external, undeveloped, conditioning.
5. Monte Carlo Methods.
6. Markov analysis.
