The overall flow of SCRAM and possible future additions.

Command-line call of SCRAM by a user
------------------------------------
Step 0. Type of analysis, i.e., fault tree, even tree, Markov chain, etc.
        Upone calling on command-line, the user should indicate which analysis
        should be performed. In addition to this, the user should provide
        additional parameters for the analysis type chosen. For example, if
        FTA is requested, type of algorithm for minimal cut set generation may
        be specified by the user, or the user can choose if probability
        calculations should assume a rare event approximation.
        However, there are default values for these parameters that tries to
        give the most optimal and accurate results.


Fault Tree Analysis.
--------------------
Step 1. Reading input files. Verification of the input. Optional visual tool.
Step 1+ (Optional). Upon users' request output instruction file for graping
    the tree. This is for visual verification of the input.
    Stop execution of the program.
Step 2. Create the tree for analysis.
Step 3. Perform cut set generation.
Step 4. Perform analysis: Rare event approximation and independence of events.
Step 5. Output the analysis results.


Event Tree Analysis.
--------------------
Step 1. Reading input files. Verification of the input. Optional visual tool.
Step 1+ (Optional). Upon users' request output instruction file for graphviz
    dot to draw the tree. This is for visual verification of the input.
    Stop execution of the program.
Step 2. Create the tree for analysis.
Step 3. Perform calculations.
Step 4. Output the results.


Future Additions.
-----------------
1. Simple event tree analysis.
2. More efficient algorithms for fault tree analysis.
3. More types of gates for fault trees: exclusive OR, priority AND, inhibit.
4. More types of events for fault trees: external, undeveloped, conditioning.
5. Monte Carlo Methods.
6. Markov analysis.


General Information for Users.
------------------------------
1. Use extensions scram specific extensions for input files as follows:
    FTA input file:     .scramf
    FTA prob file:      .scramp
2. If you are using text editor with highlighting, set filetype to 'conf'.
    This configuration like highlighting works well scram syntax.
