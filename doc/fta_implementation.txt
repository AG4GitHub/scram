Fault Tree Analysis.

Initially only naive implementations will be given. Various other algorithms
will be introduced when simple ones work.

Currently Used Data Structures and Containers
---------------------------------------------
Vector
Set
Map
Set of sets
Vector of sets


Naive Algorithm
---------------
Walk through the tree level by level starting from the root to leaves.
Update cut sets after each level.
Remove non-minimal cut sets according to rules.
Apply recursive implementation.
