Fault Tree Analysis.

Initially only naive implementations will be given. Various other algorithms
will be introduced when simple ones work.

Currently Used Data Structures and Containers
---------------------------------------------
Vector
Set
Map
Set of sets
Vector of sets


Naive Algorithm
---------------
Walk through the tree level by level starting from the root to leaves.
Update cut sets after each level.
Remove non-minimal cut sets according to rules.
Apply recursive implementation.


Probability Calculations
------------------------
Many assumptions may be applied for calculation of set and total
probabilities. Some of them are:
* Independence of events (Conditional cases may be supported in future.)
* Rare event approximation
* Brute force probability calculation if the rare event approximation fails.
    This brute force calculation may be expensive and require much more memory
    and time.
    NOTE: This feature has not yet been implemented.

For naive default calculations, rare event approximation and event
independence may be applied. However, if the rare event approximation produce
too large probability, SCRAM may switch to other better method unless the rare
event method is ENFORCED by a user upon calling SCRAM. An appropriate warning
will be given even if the user enforce a rare event approximation.
