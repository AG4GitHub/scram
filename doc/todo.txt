TODO list for SCRAM Project:
    * Define output format.
        ** Take a look at output formats of RiskMan, Isograph and OpenFTA
        ** Fractions, importance, contributions of each minimal sets
        ** May order minimal cut sets by their size, importance
    * Incorporate benchmarks into building and automation
        ** Develop new symbols, gate and event types necessary for benchmarking
            *** Conditioning event
            *** Priority AND, XOR, Inhibit, VOTE, NOT, NULL, Dormant
     [!]** Implement test cases from OpenFTA
        ** Implement test cases from Isograph.
        ** A python script to generate a tree of any size.
    * Creation of an equation from minimal cut sets for Monte Carlo simulation
        ** Uncertainty analysis basics
        ** Sampling techniques
        ** Distributions
        ** Refer to OpenFTA
    * Dump/Graph the tree for verification
    * Reformat documentation into rst.

    * Incorporation of event tree analysis
    * Incorporation of CCF
        ** Multiple Greek Letter system
        ** Alpha system
        ** Beta system
    * Incorporation of alignments
        ** Maintenance
        ** Guaranteed Success/Failure

    * Other input styles : XML, json, sql.
    * GUI considerations
    * Conditional probabilities through CCF

 [!]* Coding specific:
        ** Incorporate unit tests into building
        ** Test functions.
        ** Write tests for input files.
        ** Create input files with transferIn and TransferOut types
        ** Adjust and check for Google C++ style
        ** Capitalize comments
        ** End comments with a dot.
        ** Refactor the code
        ** Time and space complexity of all algorithms used in this package
