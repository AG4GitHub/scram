TODO list for SCRAM Project:
    * Define output format.
        ** Table like spacing for output numbers
        ** Take a look at output formats of RiskMan and Isograph
    * Incorporate benchmarks into building and automation
        ** Develop new symbols, gate and event types necessary for benchmarking
        ** Implement test cases from Isograph.
    * Creation of an equation from minimal cut sets for Monte Carlo simulation
        ** Uncertainty analysis
        ** Sensitivity analysis
        ** Sampling techniques
        ** Distributions
        ** Refer to OpenFTA: Minimal cut set generation through MC
    * Reformat documentation into rst.
    * Analysis of a transfer sub-tree without a main file.

    * Incorporation of event tree analysis
    * Incorporation of CCF
        ** Multiple Greek Letter system
        ** Alpha system
        ** Beta system
    * Incorporation of alignments
        ** Maintenance
        ** Guaranteed Success/Failure
    * Probabilities as a function of time (lambda).

    * Other input styles : XML, json, sql.
    * GUI considerations
    * Explore conditional probabilities through CCF

    * Coding specific:
        ** Incorporate unit tests into building
        ** Test functions.
        ** Write tests for input files.
        ** Test input files for TransferOut types
        ** Time and space complexity of all algorithms used in this package
