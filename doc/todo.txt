TODO list for SCRAM Project:
    * Define output format.
        ** Take a look at output formats of RiskMan, Isograph and OpenFTA
        ** Fractions, importance, contributions of each minimal sets
    * Incorporate unit tests into building
    * Test functions.
    * Write tests for input files.
        ** Create input files with transferIn and TransferOut types
    * Incorporate benchmarks into building and automation
        ** Develop new gate and event types necessary for benchmarking
        ** Implement test cases from OpenFTA and Isograph.
    * Refactor the code.
    * Creation of an equation from minimal cut sets for Monte Carlo simulation
        ** Sampling techniques
        ** Distributions
        ** Refer to OpenFTA
    * Dump/Graph the tree for verification
    * May consider using regex for input file parsing.

    * Incorporation of event tree analysis
    * Incorporation of CCF
        ** Multiple Greek Letter system
        ** Alpha system
    * Incorporation of alignments
        ** Maintenance
        ** Guaranteed Success/Failure

    * Other input styles : XML, json, sql.
    * GUI considerations
    * Conditional probabilities through CCF
