TODO list for SCRAM Project
===========================
    * Define output format.
        ** Table like spacing for output numbers
        ** Take a look at output formats of RiskMan and Isograph
        ** Option for CSV output for spreadsheet applications
        ** Save minimal cut sets for later analysis
    * Minimal cut set input file as an alternative to a tree file
 [!]* Incorporate benchmarks into building and automation
        ** Develop new symbols, gate and event types necessary for benchmarking
        ** Implement test cases from Isograph.
    * Monte Carlo Simulations
        ** Uncertainty analysis
        ** Sensitivity analysis
        ** Sampling techniques
        ** Distributions
        ** Latin Hypercube sampling technique
        ** Refer to OpenFTA: Minimal cut set generation through MC
    * Reformat documentation into rst.
    * Analysis of a transfer sub-tree without a main file.
    * Improve fault tree generator

    * Incorporation of an event tree analysis
    * Incorporation of CCF
        ** Multiple Greek Letter system
        ** Alpha system
        ** Beta system
    * Incorporation of alignments
        ** Maintenance
        ** Guaranteed Success/Failure
 [!]* Probabilities as a function of time (lambda).

    * Other input styles : XML, json, sql.
    * GUI considerations for building trees
    * Explore conditional probabilities through CCF

    * Documentation:
        ** Getting Started
        ** Building/Installing
        ** Simple Walkthrough Example
        ** Reference Papers
        ** Background Theory

    * Coding specific:
        ** Write tests for classes and functions.
            [] Benchmark cases.
            [] FTA important private functions.
                ** ProbAnd
                ** ProbOR
                ** ExpandSets
            [] Basic MC functions.
        ** Test input files for TransferOut types
        ** Time and space complexity of all algorithms used in this package
        ** Installation instructions for various platforms
