*****************
Probability Types
*****************

Various probability types and distributions are accepted
as described in the OpenPSA Model Exchange Format,
for example, constant values, exponential with two or four parameters,
and uniform, normal, log-normal distributions.

Bellow is a brief description.
For more information, please take a look at the OpenPSA_ MEF format documentation.

**P-model**
    The probability of an event occurring
    when the time to failure is unknown or unpredictable.

**Lambda-model or Exponential with Two Parameters**
    The probability that a primary event will occur within given time (t).
    Appropriate for events within systems
    that are continuously operating and
    have a known probability of failure during a unit time period (:math:`\lambda`).

    .. math::

        P = 1-\exp(-\lambda*t)

    For small lambda and time, the approximation is

    .. math::

        P \approx \lambda*t

Probability Calculations
************************

Since minimal cut sets may neither be mutually exclusive nor independent,
direct use of the sets' total probabilities may be inaccurate.
In addition, rare event approximation may not be appropriate
for events with large probabilities.

In order to account for the above deficiencies,
brute force algorithm is implemented to calculate
the total probability of the top event in a fault tree.
However, this algorithm still assumes independence of basic events in the fault tree.

The described assumptions may be applied
for calculation of a cut set and total probabilities:

- Independence of events (dependence may be simulated by common cause).
- The rare event approximation (must be enforced by a user).
- The Min-Cut-Upper Bound Approximation (must be enforced by a user).
- Cut-off probability for minimal cut sets (the default value is 1e-8).
- The brute force probability calculation
  if the rare event approximation is not good enough.
  This brute force calculation may be expensive
  and require much more time.
  (This is the default method for probability calculations.)


The Exact Probability Calculation
=================================

The general probability formula for sets is expanded recursively.
In each iteration, some sets are merged
to account for common members in minimal cut sets.
This algorithm is also used for series expansion,
giving the Sylvester-Poincar√© expansion.


The Approximate Probability Calculation
=======================================

Approximate calculations are implemented to reduce the calculation time.
The series expansion of the exact formula is applied.
The default value for series is set to 7
to get a conservative result while having acceptable performance.
In general, it is impractical to include more than 8 sums,
so the suggestion is to include between 4 and 8 sums.
In addition, cut-off probability for cut sets can be used
to discard sets with low probabilities.
The default cut-off is 1e-8.


The Rare-Event Approximation
============================

Given that the probabilities of events are very small value less than 0.1,
only the first series in the probability equation may be used
as a conservative approximation;
that is, the total probability is the sum of all probabilities of minimal cut sets.
Ideally, this approximation gives good results
for independent minimal cut sets with very low probabilities.
However, if the cut set probabilities are high,
the total probability may exceed 1.


The Min-Cut-Upper Bound (MCUB) Approximation
============================================

This method calculates the total probability
by subtracting the probability of all minimal cut sets' being successful from 1;
thus, the total probability never exceeds 1.
Non-independence of the minimal cut sets introduce the major discrepancy for this technique.
Moreover, the MCUB approximation provides non-conservative estimation
for non-coherent trees containing NOT logic.
There are other limitations
described by Don Wakefield in "You Can't Just Build Trees and Call It PSA."


*******************
Importance Analysis
*******************

Importance analysis is performed for basic events in minimal cut sets.
The same configurations are used as for probability analysis.
The analysis is performed by request with probability data.
The following factors are calculated:

    - Fussel-Vesely Diagnosis Importance Factor (DIF)
    - Birnbaum Marginal Importance Factor (MIF)
    - Critical Importance Factor (CIF)
    - Risk Reduction Worth (RRW)
    - Risk Achievement Worth (RAW)
