A description of python script to generate a tree of any size and complexity:

* Use random numbers to determine the structure of the tree.
* Number of primary events is specified by a user.
* The seed of the random number generator may be fixed and specified as well.
* Names of events in the tree must be randomly chosen between creating a
    new event or re-using already created event.
* Probabilities for primary events are generated randomly.
* Names are assigned sequentially. E# and P#.

* No support for transfer ins or outs is expected.
* No support for CCF is expected.

Script arguments:
    * Random number generator seed.
    * Number of primary events.
    * Ratio primary events to intermediate events. Average.
    * Minimum and maximum probabilities for primary events.
    * Output file name.

* The output should be an input tree file and a probability file.
