A description of python script to generate a tree of any size and complexity.
* Use random numbers to determine the structure of the tree.
* Number of basic events is specified by a user.
* The seed of the rundom number generator may be fixed and specified as well.
* Names of events in the tree must be randomly chosen between creating a
    new event or re-using already created event.
* Probabilities for primary events are generated randomly.
* No support for transfer ins or outs is expected.
* No support for CCF is expected.

* The output should be an input tree file and a probability file.
