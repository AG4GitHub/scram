Steps in Naive Algorithm for generation of minimal cut sets of a fault tree.

Rule 1. Each OR gate generates new rows in the table of cut sets
Rule 2. Each AND gate generates new columns in the table of cut sets

After each of the above steps:

Rule 3. Eliminate redundant elements that appear multiple times in a cut set
Rule 4. Eliminate non-minimal cut sets
