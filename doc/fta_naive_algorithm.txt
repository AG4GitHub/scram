Steps in Naive Algorithm for generation of minimal cut sets of a fault tree.
This algorithm is similar to the algebraic method.

Rule 1. Each OR gate generates new rows in the table of cut sets
Rule 2. Each AND gate generates new columns in the table of cut sets

After each of the above steps:

Rule 3. Eliminate redundant elements that appear multiple times in a cut set
Rule 4. Eliminate non-minimal cut sets

The actual implementation uses a set of sets in order to avoid duplicates,
so Rule 3 is satisfied automatically. Each OR gate adds new sets into the set
of sets, while each AND gate adds additional elements into one specific set
inside the set of sets.

The only algorithmically complex part is the application of Rule 4. The set of
sets traversed to find sets with size one, which are guaranteed to be
minimal. Then all other sets are checked if they are supersets of the found
minimal sets so far. If this is not the case, the sets with size 2 are
minimal. This logic is continued till the original set of the sets is empty.

Improvements for this algorithm:
    * Precalculate intermediate events.
    * Keep track of primary events in a set to eliminate by the order.
    * Switch to hash tables for maps and sets.
