Steps to verify an input for Fault Tree:
    * ignore comment lines [done]
    * find opening brace '{' [done]
    * all three input elements are listed in correct order. [done]
    * input values are correct [done]
    * each line contains only two strings [done]
    * find closing brace '}' [done]
    * create a node: [done]
        ** Parent exists and is not a basic event (may change for CCF) [done]
        ** Non-basic event has a unique name [done]
        ** Basic events with several parents are allowed (put #1) [done]
        ** Each non-basic node is not a leaf [done]
    * Throw an error with a message (line numbers, types of errors) [done]
    * Find probabilities for basic events:
        ** Report missing probabilities
        ** Throw an error if defined doubly
        ** Warn if there more probability definitions than events
