Memory utilization records for the total program.
Only the highest usage is recorded.
The build types do not affect the memory as much as the speed.
Do not confuse this memory usage recordings
with the actual allocation of the memory by the code.
The actual memory allocation must be analyzed
with memory(heap) profilers like Valgrind with Mastif.

The system specs are the same as in the speed recordings.
