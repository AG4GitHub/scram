SCRAM can be called with specific flags in order to perform FTA analysis
step by step or faster.
A user can specify to:
1. Check and validate input tree file.
2. Check probability file after checking an input tree file.
3. Find minimal cut sets only with an input tree file if no probability file
    is provided.
4. Request a graph of the tree only.
5. Set upper order for cut sets in order to speed up calculations.
6. Turn on rare event approximation for faster calculations.
7. Set analysis type.
