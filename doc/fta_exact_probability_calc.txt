Probability Calculations
========================

Upon examining many fault trees, it has been observed that minimal cut sets
may share members, which introduces inaccuracies into rare event
approximation. That is, minimal cut sets may be neither mutually exclusive
nor independent. In addition, rare event approximation may not be appropriate
for events with large probabilities.

In order to account for the above deficiencies, naive brute force algorithm is
implemented to calculate total probability of a top event in a
fault tree. However, note that this algorithm still assumes independence of
primary events in the fault tree.


Exact Probability Calculation Implementation Description
--------------------------------------------------------
The general probability formula for sets is expanded recursively.
In each iteration, some sets are merged in order to account for common members
in minimal cut sets.

Approximate Probability Calculation
-----------------------------------
Approximate calculations may be implemented in order to reduce calculation
time. The series expansion of the exact formula may be applied as in OpenFTA.
This may be an option for a user.

Probability Types
-----------------
1. P-model : the probability of an event occurring when the time to failure is
             unknown or unpredictable.
2. Lambda-model : the probability that a primary event will occur with within
                  a given period of time. Appropriate for events within
                  systems that are continuously operating and have a known
                  probability of failure during a unit time period.
                  The event probability is equal to 1-exp(-lambda*time).
                  For small lambda and time, the approximation is lambda*time.
