Minor Issues
====================

- Input files with currently-unsupported, advanced-OpenPSA-MEF features may
  cause program failures without any warnings.

- The current algorithms are not optimized for complex analysis, but
  more optimization is planned after main features are implemented.

- Non-coherent trees may not guarantee valid results. Non-coherent trees are
  not fully tested yet.
