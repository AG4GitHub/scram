Upon examining many fault trees, it has been observed that minimal cut sets
may share members, which introduces inaccuracies into rare event
approximation. In addition, rare event approximation may not be appropriate
for events with large probabilities.

In order to account for the above deficiencies, naive brute force algorithm is
going to be implemented to calculate total probability of a top event in a
fault tree. However, note that this algorithm still assumes independence of
basic events in the fault tree.

Implementation Description
--------------------------
Recursive calls will be used to account for common members in minimal cut
sets.
