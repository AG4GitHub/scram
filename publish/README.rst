SCRAM Website
#############

The three branch system is used to build the website:

    **develop** -> **gh-source** -> **gh-pages**

This is the final destination of the generated files from *gh-pages*.
This branch contains files for SCRAM website and API documentation.

The files are transfered from *build/html* and *build/api/html*.

The publishing bash script is provided that does the steps described bellow.

To run the script:

.. code-block:: bash

    bash publish.sh

The example publishing steps:

    #. Clean previous web files that are going to be replaced.
    #. Clean all irrelevant files.
    #. Copy contents of *build/html/* into the root directory.
    #. Make *api/* directory.
    #. Copy contents of *build/api/html/* into the *api/* directory.
    #. Add changes and new files.

.. note::
    There are several files that are not autogenerated, so they should not be
    deleted. For example, the publishing script should stay.
